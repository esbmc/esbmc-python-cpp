Convert this Python code to C code that can be verified by ESBMC. The conversion must be complete and systematic, following these strict requirements:

1. Code Structure and Completeness:
- Convert ALL code, including every class, method, and function
- Maintain the exact same logic and error conditions as the original code
- Preserve all verification properties and assertions
- Convert all class methods to C functions with appropriate struct handling
- Keep the same file structure and organization
- All functions must be implemented, even if they are not used
- The converted function, method and class must be complete with their logic  

2. Error Handling and Assertions:
- Preserve all logical errors exactly as they appear in the Python code
- Do not fix or improve error conditions - they should be converted as-is
- Convert Python exceptions to C assertions or error codes
- For silent exception handling in Python (using 'pass'), use equivalent silent handling in C
- For raised exceptions in Python, use assertions in C
- When Python code has exception handling, implement the same error flow in C

3. Data Structures and Memory:
- Use fixed-size arrays instead of dynamic allocation where possible
- Define appropriate size constants for arrays (e.g., MAX_LENGTH)
- Convert Python data structures to C equivalents:
  * lists -> fixed-size arrays
  * dictionaries -> structs with key-value pairs
  * classes -> structs with associated functions
  * strings -> char arrays with fixed maximum size
- Avoid using malloc/free when fixed-size alternatives are possible
- When dynamic allocation is necessary, ensure proper memory management

4. Function Specifications:
- Do not use function pointers
- All function parameters should be passed by value or as direct pointers
- Maintain original function signatures as closely as possible while adapting to C
- Preserve const correctness where appropriate

5. Error Detection:
- Add parameter validation at the start of each function
- Use assert() for validation without additional conditions
- Keep assertions semantically equivalent to Python's error checking

6. Special Features Handling:
- For threading code:
  * Include <pthread.h>
  * Use standard pthread functions
  * Maintain thread count bounds
  * Implement proper mutex handling
- For Python built-ins:
  * Convert range() to for loops with explicit bounds
  * Convert list comprehensions to explicit loops
  * Convert map/filter to explicit loops
  * Implement equivalent string handling functions

7. Random Number Handling:
- Keep random number generation as-is, don't convert to nondet
- Use random() for direct random number generation
- Maintain original random number ranges

8. Verification Properties:
- Add ESBMC-specific annotations where needed
- Keep loop bounds explicit and verifiable
- Maintain all verification conditions from the original code

9. Constants and Definitions:
- Define appropriate size limits for all arrays and buffers
- Convert Python constants to #define or const variables
- Maintain naming conventions from the original code

10. Input/Output Handling:
- Convert Python file operations to C file operations
- Maintain the same file handling logic
- Convert print statements to printf or fprintf
- Handle string formatting appropriately

11. Documentation:
- Preserve all comments and documentation
- Add C-style comments for important functions
- Document any critical conversions or assumptions

12. code converted to c must correspond 100% to python code

Example of a correct conversion pattern:

Python:
```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        
    def process(self, data):
        try:
            result = data / self.value
            return result
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            pass
```
C equivalent:

```c
#define MAX_LENGTH 100

typedef struct {
    int value;
} MyClass;

void init_my_class(MyClass* obj, int value) {
    assert(obj != NULL);
    obj->value = value;
}

bool process(MyClass* obj, int data, int* result) {
    assert(obj != NULL);
    assert(result != NULL);
    
    if (obj->value == 0) {
        // Silent handling as in Python
        return false;
    }
    
    *result = data / obj->value;
    return true;
}
```
