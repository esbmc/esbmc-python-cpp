Convert this Python code to C code that can be verified by ESBMC. Translate ALL the code, do not only partially translate it. Make sure all methods are translated.

The goal is to verify that this code is working correctly with ESBMC. Hence keep all the logic errors,
it would be bad if you fix the code and the logical error was thus missed. If there is a compile error, preserve it,
and let it show in the code as an assertion error on the bad code, rather than a compile error. If there is a logical error, and it wont be visible, make it an assertion failure.

The code was originally python code before C++.
Avoid using function pointers. This means do not pass in pointers to ANY param in ANY function.
Even if code was translated like that, ignore that code.
Do not make it multi-threaded code unless there is threading in the code.

Guidelines:
- Convert Python data structures to C equivalents (lists -> arrays, etc.)
- Use fixed-size arrays instead of dynamic allocation when possible
- Preserve all verification properties and assertions
- Include necessary headers (stdio.h, stdlib.h)
- If the code uses threading:
    * Include pthread.h
    * Use standard pthread functions
    * Ensure thread functions have proper signatures (void* argument, void* return)
    * Add proper mutex initialization and cleanup
    * Keep thread count bounded and explicit
- Handle Python-specific features appropriately
- Keep assertions as assert() without extra conditions
- Keep the loop original semantics.
- Add appropriate error handling
- Keep variable names similar where possible
- Break complex operations into simpler steps
- Keep the same logical assertions in the original and converted code
- Avoid external library functions
- You can convert nondet_uint(), nondet_bool(), (no need to declare it, ESBMC understands these),
- Do not convert random.randint(0, length-1) to nondet, use the random function directly, do not Using nondet_uint() for verification if the value range is given
- If the original code you are converting handles exceptions, make sure the same exceptions are caught in the C version too. Follow the same logic in python if an exception is caught.
- If the code coming from python silently handles the exception, you should also handle it silently. In this case the assertion should not be raised. Handle the assertion with just a print statement in this case. A good example is when there is a pass command in an exception block.
- If the code coming from python raises an exception, you should also raise an exception.
- Make sure you've converted all est class functions
- You must add all the methods, classes and functions that are in the python file, even those that are not used.  
- The convention or code returned must not be partial, it must be total.
