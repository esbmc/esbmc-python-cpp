Compare these two code files. The first is the original code and the second is its translation to C.
Verify that the translation maintains:
1. All functional behavior
2. All verification properties and assertions
3. Proper handling of data structures
4. Threading behavior (if present)
5. Error handling
6. Keep the same logical assertions
7. Keep the loop original semantics. For example, for y in range(1, 5, 1) must be translated to for(y = 1; y < 5; y++). Pay attention to the logical conditions
8. Do not fix division by zero
If you find any issues, provide the corrected C code that fixes these issues, following the 8 items above.
If no issues are found, just respond with 'TRANSLATION_OK'.

Focus on correctness and verification properties.
