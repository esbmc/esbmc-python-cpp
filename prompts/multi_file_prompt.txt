When converting multiple Python files to a single C program:

1. Start with proper header includes:
   - Standard C libraries (stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, etc.)
   - Any custom headers needed

2. Forward declare all functions and types to avoid dependency issues

3. For each Python module:
   - Create a corresponding section in the C file with clear comments
   - Maintain the original function signatures where possible
   - Convert classes to appropriate C structures with associated functions

4. Handle imports by ensuring functions from one module can access functions from another

5. Convert Python-specific features:
   - Replace dynamic typing with appropriate C types
   - Implement Python's built-in functions (len, print, etc.)
   - Create appropriate data structures for lists, dictionaries, etc.
   - Handle string operations carefully

6. Preserve the execution flow:
   - Ensure initialization happens in the correct order
   - Maintain the original control flow
   - Preserve the entry point logic

7. Add appropriate error handling where needed

8. Include a main() function that calls the appropriate entry point from the main file

9. Complete all methods as detailed as possible, do not leave any methods or lines incomplete.

Remember to maintain the relationships between files and ensure all dependencies are properly resolved.
